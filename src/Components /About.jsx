          Being a business developer for multiple businesses has allowed me to
          gain domain knowledge in multiple sectors. I have recently shifted my
          focus to the IT industry - Healthcare in particular. I have conceived
          a product called Know.me which gives health facilities, companies, and
          individuals a higher level of safety by providing easy access to vital
          information in critical situations.
